Before detecting abuse ,block clients and applying adaptive limits on clients we have to measure traffic reliably and fast.

To do so i'll be using Redis because of:

* in-memory

* atomic operations

* TTL(time to leave) support

So, in this module i will count how many requests happened in a time window by a client.

For each request

`Client -> FingerprintFilter -> RateLimitFilter -> Controller`

RateLimiterFilter will:
* Read fingerprint
* Increment Redis counter
* if count > limit -> block(http 429)
* else -> allow request

REDIS KEY DESIGN:

rate:{fingerprint}:{windowStart}
`rate:fpt_abc123:1704367800
`
For now to keep things simple 

Window -> 60 seconds

Max requests -> 10

Later i'll make this adaptive
