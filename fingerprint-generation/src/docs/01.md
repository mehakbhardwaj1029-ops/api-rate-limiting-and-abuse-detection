Why IP is used even tho it comes with various drawbacks:

1. NAT → thousands of users share one IP

2. Mobile networks rotate IPs

3. Proxies & VPNs hide real IP

4. Attackers can spoof headers


because we are performing rate limiting not authentication 

* We are not concerned about the "proof of identity" , what we are identifying is "Suspicion score" i.e; which client is requesting resources in abundance.

* Rate limiting is probabilistic, not authentication.

* We are increasing cost of abuse, not proving identity.

IP is just one signal, not the authority.

`Fingerprint is a traffic classification mechanism not a security mechanism.
`

It is a very crucial thing to not mix different concepts, if we want to make a good system we have to ensure that every module or service does what it is supposed to do , like in this case i started questioning myself about the authenticity of client making request (which is handled by a different module)but while implementing rate limiting the thing i should be concerned about is knowing from where the suspicious requests are coming from.


API Key - used for primary identity

API keys are:
issued ,rotated ,revoked

* Rate limits are per key, not per IP

* If attacker steals API key:

* You detect unusual patterns

* You revoke it

IP - used for location and rate signal.
